# --------------------

# - the path and name of the database executor
# - the command line of the database executor (except the test log file containing the test results - is considered internally)
# The log file ("LOGFILE") is taken over from setion "COMPONENTS" and must not be defined here!
# A global command line (similar to --robotcommandline and --pytestcommandline) is not available for database executors (only "LOCALCOMMANDLINE").
# In every case the Test Trigger command line must contain all parameters - also the ones that are optional for the affected database executor
# (because they are a fix part of "LOCALCOMMANDLINE").
# "LOCALCOMMANDLINE" is optional; other keys of section "TESTTYPES" are required.
